            Acts 1, Jesus calls us to wait. To wait on Him. To wait on His
            promise.
            <br />
            <br />
            This <q>waiting</q> is what I feel the season I am in right now. Waiting
            for new work or to be married. Not saying that I am on hiatus until
            one of these happens, but waiting in the sense that these events are
            my new big <q>checkpoints.</q> They divide my seasons. They may be long,
            they may be short. Who knows. But what I do know is what I am called
            to do in this moment. He calls me to wait on Him. To pray, to seek,
            to chase after His presence. Praying is waiting on the Lord.
            <br />
            <br />
            Bring to Him your desires, your fears.
            <br />
            <br />
            Wait.
            <br />
            <br />
            On.
            <br />
            <br />
            Him.
            <br />
            <br />
            <br />
            Serve.
            <br />
            <br />
            Him.
            <br />
            <br />
            <br />
            Witness.
            <br />
            <br />
            Him.
