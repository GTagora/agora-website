            To my friends in all the places...
            <br />
            how do you do?
            <br />
            i hope you&apos;ve been doing wonderfully and that the Lord is blessing
            you
            <br />
            life back in Dallas has been absolutely wonderful
            <br />
            it&apos;s crazy how much can happen in 4 months,
            <br />
            but if you really think about it, that&apos;s about the same length as a
            semester
            <br />
            anyways...
            <br />
            sometimes it&apos;s strange and lonely
            <br />
            to think that everyone i meet here only sees the transformed me
            <br />
            as i share my testimony and story, i am reminded of his goodness
            <br />
            His mercy
            <br />
            and His love for me <br />
            and it also makes me think of yall <br />
            to those who loved and prayed for me <br />
            who supported and cried with me <br />
            i can&apos;t wait to see you again <br />
            whether on earth or in heaven <br />
            but until then, <br />
            until then... <br />
            i hope you all continue to run after Him <br />
            and until I see you again... <br />
            may the Lord continue to bless you
