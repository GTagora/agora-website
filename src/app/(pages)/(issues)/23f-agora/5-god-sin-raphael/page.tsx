					If God is all good, then he must not want his creation to suffer. If
					God is all powerful, then he must have the means to make it so. Why,
					then, is there sin in this world? Why is there suffering? Does the
					existence of sin contradict the existence of God?
				</b>
			</p>
			<br />
			<p>
				This is, in its simplest form, the problem of evil. Maybe you’ve never
				thought of it in this way before, but I’m sure something similar has at
				least crossed your mind at some point - that question of why God would
				allow for sin and suffering to exist. It definitely crosses my mind all
				the time. It’s a question that people have been trying to answer since
				before Christ came to earth - take Greek philosopher Epicurus, who said
				(in paraphrase):
				<i><q>
					Is God willing to prevent evil, but not able? Then he is not
					omnipotent. Is he able, but not willing? Then he is malevolent. Is he
					both able and willing? Then from whence comes evil?
				</q></i>
			</p>
			<p>
				While I don’t believe that there will ever be a perfect satisfactory
				answer to this question until we are standing face to face with God, I
				do think it’s one that many struggling in their faith will come across
				at one point or another. In writing this, I hope to provide my thoughts
				on this question and how I reconciled it in my own mind. My answer is
				not, in any shape or form, objective truth: It is what I believe based
				on scripture and my current, limited understanding of God’s character. I
				could be completely wrong, though I would hope not. It’s not meant to be
				a definite answer either, simply a starting point to help you think.
			</p>
			<p>
				Before I begin my reasoning, there are some points of importance that
				have to be established. First, I am not writing this to prove the
				existence of God - I am trying to prove that the existence of the
				all-powerful, all-knowing, and all-good God that I believe in and the
				existence of sin is not contradictory. As such, the basis of my
				reasoning asserts that both God and sin exist on Earth, which I believe
				as a Christian to be true, and upon which I build my argument
				reconciling these two existences.
			</p>
			<p>
				Secondly, I will use scripture to support definitions or lines of
				reasoning, which some may consider circular logic. However, looking at
				the verses will reveal that most of them simply provide a scriptural
				basis for the premises that I’m presenting: for example, Hebrews 4:13,
				relaying the omniscience of God, which is a characteristic of His we are
				already proposing to be true in order to set up the problem of evil. In
				cases where this is not evident, scripture is used to provide
				clarification for otherwise more unclear matters and holds true because
				of the basis of the problem - since God is all-good and all-knowing, and
				His Word reflects his character, it can be held as truth. This point is
				probably easy to disagree with me on, and I’m sure some will, so I will
				try and write this so that it holds to just reasoning as well.
			</p>
			<p>
				Finally, you may notice that as I’m tackling this problem I’ll be mostly
				focusing on the coexistence of God and sin in particular. Yes, this can
				be seen as a simplification of the argument. However, I chose to use sin
				as an overarching term for suffering, death, and the general “bad” in
				the world because it allows for a more direct approach to the issue
				rather than trying to tackle all the aspects of wrong that we see in the
				world - and, more importantly, because as a Christian, I believe that
				all of what I mentioned above came as a result of sin (Romans 5:12).
			</p>
			<br />
			<p>So what is sin?</p>
			<p>
				Scripture says sin is the transgression of the law of God (1 John 3:4).
				If God’s law is perfect (Psalm 19:7-9), then sin is lawlessness - in
				other words, sin is what is not of God, because God is perfect. There is
				God, and then there is sin, anything apart from God. This should hold
				true whether you believe in the validity of scripture or not. Does that
				mean it’s impossible for God to sin? Isn’t that contradictory to his
				omnipotent nature? Well, not exactly.
			</p>
			<p>
				Scripture doesn’t say whether God <i>can</i> sin, but it does say
				whether he <i>would</i> - and obviously, the answer is no (2 Samuel
				22:31). But to assume God chooses not to sin is also incorrect, as that
				statement implies that what is sin and what is not sin is out of his
				decree. It’s more accurate to say that God <i>does not</i> sin. It’s not
				that he lacks the ability to, or decides not to, but that it contradicts
				his character. God is the definition of holiness, absolute purity
				(Habakkuk 1:13), and it is that perfect character that determines what
				is and what is not sin (James 4:12). It’s not a matter of choice, but of
				character. There, God is omnipotent: he has the ultimate decision, the
				ability to do - or not do - anything that he decides. God is perfect,
				and what is not God is sin.
			</p>
			<p>
				So how do we explain the existence of sin, if it’s not something that
				God would want, and not something that God does? To answer that, I’d
				like to start from the concept of free will.
			</p>
			<p>
				Free will is a rather complicated topic that intertwines with other
				topics of debate, like predestination. However, for now I’ll just focus
				on the idea of free will - our freedom to make choices in our lives. We
				know that we have the freedom to sin or to not sin, the choice to follow
				God or disobey him, both from scripture (Galatians 5:13) and from… well,
				life. It seems contradictory, then, that a God who desires for good
				would allow his creation the ability to do evil. To answer this, I’ll
				pose another question: why would God give us freedom in the first place?
				It seems like creation would be a lot simpler if all we did was worship
				the Creator, even if we couldn’t do anything else - and in the presence
				of God, why would we want to do anything else anyways?
			</p>{" "}
			<br />
			<p>
				I guess when I phrase it that way the answer is rather obvious, if
				cliche.
			</p>
			<br />
			<p>
				<b>Love.</b>
			</p>
			<p>
				God loves us (1 John 4:16, Psalms 136), and he also wants us to love him
				- but would it be requited love if we didn’t have a choice otherwise? CS
				Lewis says it nicely in Mere Christianity:
				<i>
					“Free will, though it makes evil possible, is also the only thing that
					makes possible any love or goodness or joy worth having. A world of
					automata - of creatures that worked like machines - would hardly be
					worth creating. The happiness which God designs for His higher
					creatures is the happiness of being freely, voluntarily united to Him
					and to each other in an ecstasy of love and delight compared with
					which the most rapturous love between a man and a woman on this earth
					is mere milk and water.”
				</i>
				Here is the intersection of free will and love - for us to truly love
				Him, we must choose God. God created us with love, and because of this
				love, he in turn lets us choose what to love.
			</p>
			<p>
				He gives us this choice, but he also demonstrates his love in an even
				more beautiful way - and this is where the redemption story comes in.
				The existence of sin not only allows for us to choose God, it also
				allows for God to choose us - not a choice between humans and sin, since
				God is perfect, but the choice of humans <i>even though</i> we sin
				(Romans 5:8). God showed us his love through the gospel story: the
				sending of Jesus and his death and resurrection makes it possible for us
				to even have the possibility of choosing God, of choosing a perfect
				being when we are so far from perfect ourselves (1 John 4:9-10). He
				didn’t just give us free will and then dip, he gave us exact directions
				on how to choose him - through his son, Jesus Christ (John 14:6). The
				reconciliation of man and God is a testament of how much he loves his
				creation, that he would take on everything we’ve done against him just
				so we could have the chance to be with him again.
			</p>
			<p>But for there to be a choice, there must be choices.</p>
			<p>
				In order for us to choose God, we have to be able to choose <i>not</i>{" "}
				God - or, sin. God detests sin (Psalm 11:5, Proverbs 8:13), don’t get me
				wrong. Sin does not have a place in eternity with him. However, because
				he loves us, he allows us to have the choice of God or sin. We know that
				God wants us to choose him (2 Peter 3:9) - he doesn’t want any of his
				creation to perish. But in order for us to actually come to him, to
				actually love him, he gives us the choice to turn away in the hope that,
				like the prodigal son, we will eventually come back to his open arms.
			</p>
			<br />
			<p>
				<i>
					[Now, I want to quickly address something I mentioned earlier, and
					that is the topic of predestination. There’s multiple verses on the
					multitude God chooses for salvation (Romans 8:29-30, Ephesians 1:5)
					that points out a seemingly glaring problem with my argument: if God
					has already chosen who will be saved, what’s the point of us making
					the choice in the first place? I believe that the answer to this lies
					in the paradox of both God’s omniscience and his omnipotence, but I
					will not address that here - you’ll just have to trust me for now that
					I believe it is solvable).{" "}
				</i>
			</p>
			<br />
			<p>
				Therefore, I believe the existence of sin does not contradict the
				existence of an all-good, all-powerful God. God did not create evil, but
				he does allow for its existence because in his love he has given us the
				free will to choose to love him. He is not responsible for sin, yet he
				allows it because without it, there can be no love, and without love,
				creation would not be worth existing at all. The redemption story of
				Jesus Christ is proof that while God allows evil to exist, he has also
				provided a way for us to choose him, and he will always pursue us, even
				when we choose sin.
			</p>
			<p>
				<br />
				<b>
					Conclusion: It is the love of God that makes our choice between God
					and sin so significant, for it is through our choice that we can be
					saved.
