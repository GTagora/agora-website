                  i. <br /> something keeps pulling me back
                  <br /> to this well of grief.
                  <br /> i could sit here for hours, maybe,
                  <br /> staring at the reflections,
                  <br /> drawing up memories to drink &ndash; <br /> tepid and
                  stale, but tasting just enough
                  <br /> of golden hours and shadowed laughter
                  <br /> that i can&apos;t stop coming back
                  <br /> for more and
                  <br /> more and
                  <br /> more.

                  <br /> a thousand paths, sleepwalking,
                  <br /> exhaustion and envy and loneliness
                  <br /> regret and silence and fear.
                  <br /> all it takes is an image or a word
                  <br /> and i&apos;m back, <br /> running off the path,
                  <br /> wandering through the ruins
                  <br /> of the kingdom i built him in my head,
                  <br /> collapsing at this well to drink.
                  <br /> wrong kingdom. wrong well.
                  <br /> i know it,
                  <br /> but the pain is so familiar that
                  <br /> it feels like home.
