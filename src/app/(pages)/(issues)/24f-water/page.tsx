            Dear Reader,
            <br />
            <br /> It’s a joy and honor to bring you this third issue of{" "}
            <i>Agora</i>, enveloped and sealed in His gracious love for all of
            us. Each semester, we are astounded by God’s merciful provision of
            contributors, talents, time, and resources; the very journal you’re
            holding is a miracle in itself, and we invite you to join us in
            celebrating His goodness in these pages!
            <br />
            <br /> We’d like to introduce this installation’s theme,{" "}
            <i>Water</i>. It’s well known that water is essential to life: it
            sustains our individual beings, our ecosystems, our planet. It’s so
            fundamental that we often forget its necessity; instead, it’s one of
            many undercurrents that support our interests, obligations, and
            priorities. It’s only in seasons of drought that we realize how
            precious water is, how life-giving, and how frail we become without
            proper hydration. <br />
            <br /> We sometimes fall into a similar rhythm in our relationship
            with Christ, especially amidst the busyness and distraction of this
            world. Water, then, in its many forms can emulate our relationship
            with the Father, through both gentle streams and violent hurricanes.
            This semester, our writers meditated on water in its
            multidimensionality, especially as it has reflected God’s character
            and presence in their lives. Through their witness and His grace,
            we’ve seen the evidence of God’s love overflow onto these pages.
            <br />
            <br /> So take a moment, grab your favorite drink, and spend some
            time with these pieces. And as you dwell, may He fill your cup and
            nourish you with His precious living water.
            <br />
            <br /> Yours in Christ,
            <br /> Catherine Tian & Olivia Hu
